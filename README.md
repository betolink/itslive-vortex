# A Python client for ITSLIVE glacier velocity data.

In addition to NetCDF image pairs and mosaics, ITS_LIVE produces cloud-optimized Zaar datacubes, which contain all image-pair data, co-aligned on a common grid for simplified data access. Cloud optimization enables rapid analysis without intermediary data servers, and ITS_LIVE datacubes map directly into Python xarray or Julia ZArray structures. ITS_LIVE provides basic access and plotting tools in both Python and Julia, making it easy to incorporate the datacubes into workflows locally or on remote servers.
